### Additional Tips
- **Images and code blocks:** Use Markdown syntax for including images and code blocks. For example, a code block:
  ```python
  def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
  ```

  And an image:
  ```markdown
  ![Project Logo](https://example.com/your-project-logo.png)
  ```
- **Syntax highlighting:** For code examples, include the language after three backticks (`) like this:
  ```python
  def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
  ```
- **Links and references:** Use Markdown link syntax for external resources:
  ```markdown
  [Google](https://www.google.com)
  ```
- **Bullet and numbered lists:** For clearer instructions or itemized lists.

Make sure to keep the README concise yet informative. Avoid too much detail in the README; instead, link to other documents or sections within your project for detailed documentation.
